■ Of course, we want to know whether people learned something, and most of you will want to track and report that people learned something. So at the end of the e-learning course, you can present a standard quiz using multiple choice and true/false questions. At this point, grading the quiz is appropriate and learners should be told that the final quiz will be graded.
